This is meant to be used as an alternative to archinstall. This is mostly just so that I can easily make a new VM with everything ready in just some minutes.

HOW TO USE:
In the Live ISO for Arch Linux.
1. pacman -Sy git     -- This is to both update and sync pacman and to install git, if git fails just do pacman -S git.
2. git clone https://github.com/Eddieddg1/AIS.git
3. cd AIS
4. chmod +x OneScriptTest.sh
5. ./OneScriptTest.sh
6. Follow directions then reboot.
7. You should now have a working Arch VM, keyword as of now: "Should"
